## Important changes

### Restructuring of inventory pool fields

Various information in regards to an inventory pool has been restuctured:

  * There is a new **contact**  as well as **email_signature** field. 
  * The **contact** field as well as **holidays** and **workdays** are now being displayed in addition to the **description** on the show page of an inventory pool in the borrow section. 
  * **New email template variables** have been introduced accordingly.

Steps needed to be taken after installation of this release:
1. The contact information in the description field should be moved to its dedicated contact field to avoid redundancy.
2. The opening times information can be deleted from the description field to avoid redundancy. 
3. Email templates of the inventory pools should be checked and adjusted accordingly in order to use the new template variables:
  * `inventory_pool.contact`
  * `inventory_pool.description`
  * `inventory_pool.workdays`
  * `inventory_pool.holidays`
  * `inventory_pool.email_signature`

### Making some settings pool-local instead of global

Following settings which were global previously have been made pool-local:
* **Reservation advance days**
* **Deliver order received notification**
* **Email signature**

If a particular pool needs its own setting, it can do so now. Previous global values has been taken over the the pool-local settings. In case of the email signature, the global setting has been retained and can be used in email templates as before.

### Category management moved to admin

Category entities have always been global across all inventory pools so their management has been moved to the admin section and only an admin can do that from now on. Assignment of models to the categories can still be done from within any inventory pool though.
