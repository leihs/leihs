### admin

- **Admins need to do the following after upgrading to this version:**
  - database consistency issues regarding Delegations have been fixed. Existing Delegations have been automatically corrected, but _they have to be checked and corrected by the respective inventory managers!_
  - Delegations without a name get a new name: "CHECK NAME".
  - Delegations without a responsible user get a prefix like: "CHECK RESPONSIBLE USER: (old name)" and the first member is selected as the responsible user.
  - Delegations without a responsible user and a name get a prefix like: "CHECK NAME, CHECK RESPONSIBLE USER: (old name)" and the first member is selected as the responsible user.
