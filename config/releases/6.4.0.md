### general

#### new "borow" app for mobile devices

This release adds a new Leihs Borrow app. Users can now easily reserve items on their mobile devices. Additionally users can set their favorite items, reorder from existing orders and cancel their order if not yet accepted by a lending manager. The new look and feel will soon be adapted for larger devices too. For the time beeing users have possibity to switch back and forth from "classic" or "legacy" Leihs to the new Borrow App. Any feedback to the new Borrow App can be posted as an issue on https://github.com/leihs/leihs/issues.

For deployment, the config flags that can be set and their defaults are as follows (see `deploy/all.yml` for details):

- `LEIHS_DEPLOY_NEW_BORROW_APP: no`: set to `yes` to deploy the new borrow app
- `LEIHS_NEW_BORROW_APP_SHOW_NOTICE_IN_LEGACY: yes`: if set to `yes`, and the new borrow app is installed, show a notice with link in the old borrow app
- `LEIHS_NEW_BORROW_APP_SHOW_NOTICE_IN_LEGACY_TEXTS` is a map that defines the text for the aforementioned notice for all supported languages
