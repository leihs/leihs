- new "system admin" role: settings that were previously only editable on the server by the `root` user can now be set in the admin UI.
  to use this feature, manually promote at least 1 user account to "system admin". this user account can then promote others in the admin UI.

  ```sh
  root@leihs-server:~# SYSADMIN_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" \
    psql -d leihs -c "update users set is_admin=TRUE,is_system_admin=TRUE where id='$SYSADMIN_ID';"
  ```
