  Background:

  @inspection
  Scenario: What to see in section "Requests" as inspector
    Given I am Barbara
    And several requests exist for my categories
    When I navigate to the requests overview page
    Then the current budget period is selected
    And only my categories are selected
    And only categories having requests are selected
    And all organisations are selected
    And both priorities are selected
    And all inspector's priorities are selected
    And the state "In inspection" is not present
    And all states are selected
    And the search field is empty
    And the checkbox "Only show my own request" is not marked
    And I see the headers of the columns of the overview
    And I see the amount of requests listed
    And I see the current budget period
    And I see the total amount of each sub category for each budget period
    And the total amount is calculated by adding the following amounts
      | quantity  | state              |
      | requested | new                |
      | order     | accepted           |
      | order     | partially accepted |
    And I see the total of all budget limits of the shown main categories for each budget period
    And I see the budget limit of each main category for each budget period
    And I see the total amount of each main category for each budget period
    And the total amount is calculated by adding all totals of the sub category
    And I see the percentage of budget used compared to the budget limit of the main categories
    And I see when the requesting phase of this budget period ends
    And I see when the inspection phase of this budget period ends
    And for each request I see the following information
      | article name          |
      | name of the requester |
      | organisation          |
      | price                 |
